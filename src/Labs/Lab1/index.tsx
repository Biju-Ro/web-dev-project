        <h4>Heading Tags</h4>
        Text documents are often broken up into several sections and
        subsections. Each section is usually prefaced with a short title or
        heading that attempts to summarize the topic of the section it precedes.
        For instance this paragraph is preceded by the heading Heading Tags. The
        font of the section headings are usually larger and bolder than their
        subsection headings. This document uses headings to introduce topics
        such as HTML Documents, HTML Tags, Heading Tags, etc. HTML heading tags
        can be used to format plain text so that it renders in a browser as
        large headings. There are 6 heading tags for different sizes: h1, h2,
        h3, h4, h5, and h6. Tag h1 is the largest heading and h6 is the smallest
        heading.

        <h4>Paragraph Tag</h4>
        <p id="wd-p-1">
          This is a paragraph. We often separate a long set of sentences with
          vertical spaces to make the text easier to read. Browsers ignore
          vertical white spaces and render all the text as one single set of
          sentences. To force the browser to add vertical spacing, wrap the
          paragraphs you want to separate with the paragraph tag
        </p>
        <p id="wd-p-2">
          This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format
          vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.
        </p>
        <p id="wd-p-3">
          This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white
          gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default
          browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on
          the right.
        </p>
        <p id="wd-p-4">
          This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph
          tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.
